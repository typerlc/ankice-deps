  update sync & upgrade code, set deckVersion on creation
  - syncing now sends a protocol and client version on checkAuth
  - don't touch lastModified when converting to the fc scheduler
  - when correcting for sm5 mischeduling, do so idempotently
  - make sure to convert new fc card attributes to float/int

  * move to new scheduling algorithm, add lang updates, etc
  
  The new scheduling algorithm is more conservative than sm5, and fixes a number
  of problems with cards being scheduled too far into the future. The factor
  matrix has been removed in favour of per-card factor modification. Each card
  starts at factor=1.5, with factorChange=0.05. Easy cards are increased by
  factorChange, difficult cards are reduced by it. In the future factorChange
  could be modified to speed up ease adjustments.
  
  The new algorithm has five ease levels when answering a card, instead of the
  earlier 6.
  
  - track totalCount, correctCount and succesivelyCorrect in cards for future
    statistics
  - apply deviation just before scheduling, so we don't confuse the user
  - add quasi-i18n support via setLang to set format of fc string output
  - add deckFormat and deckVersion to ease future upgrades
  - fc.sched is now the default algorithm and doesn't require makeDefault()
  - remove emacs deck conversion support (it was a hack)
  - move emacs support and utilities into separate directories
  - add GPL boilerplates & COPYING

  * LaC lazy launch of kakasi
  - kakasi is launched only when first used
  - simpler availability check

Wed Jan 24 08:04:40 PST 2007  LaC
  * LaC shared kakasi
  - use a single instance of kakasi, instead of launching it anew on every
    keystroke; this makes the "add cards" dialog more responsive, at least on
    my system
